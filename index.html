            <h5><a href="https://loyalty-app.herokuapp.com/">loyalty-app.herokuapp.com</a></h5>
            <p>Currently working on this app for creating a phone number based loyalty rewards system for customers to earn points/rewards at a retail business. Building the app via Test Driven Development with integration tests using Rspec and Capybara. Solidified more knowledge with routing. I am using bootstrap for the front-end. Did use the activeadmin gem, but later took it off because I wanted to learn and create a simplier admin dashboard. Additional features I am looking to build is an admin feature that allows admins to add points to the customer and for customer to use their earned points/rewards.</p>

            <p>My Dev Bootcamp Final 7 Day project in Rails - Trail Head is a hiking trail finder using Google Maps API and Trail API to give you hiking points all around the United States. Click on a trail to open up the specific trail's page giving you a chance to upload pictures and leave comments. Another feature that was developed was to be able to add new trail points to the map. Learned many things like how to build out a photo carousel and using carrier wave to upload pictures. Then being able to save the pictures to an Amazon S3 Server (finally without compromising the server key). Learned how to use CodeShip for continuous intergration/deployment to Heroku.</p>
