          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>These are the first live production projects I've worked on that I'm really proud of to contribute to. UA Bootstrap is a flavor of Bootstrap that has been customized to reflect the branding and marketing of the University of Arizona. I am constantly adding new elements, and improving existing elements. I've helped create new classes that are contributed back to the repository making it available to anyone on campus who uses UA Bootstrap on their sites. UA Quickstart is grand project I've been helping contribute to. It is a Drupal distribution profile that uses UA Bootstrap and themes to create the bones of a website. I generally describe UA Quickstart as our platform for building sites. I constantly help add new features, and new elements (in Drupal language, help create modules) that improve the platform. Notable accomplishments have been creating a new navigation menu layout, helped make accessibility improvements with landmarks, and created new SEO modules to help with SEO. That is just a few accomplishments, but while we improve on the platform, we are also bringing old sites onto the new platform, most notably the main institution site arizona.edu is on UA Quickstart. Adopting sites onto our platform in short has helped with reducing technical debt and creating sites faster and easier, ease of use for developers who use this for building sites and content editors who maintain the content on the sites, and having the ability to keep sites updated with the most recent security updates and bug fixes.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>This was a code challenge for a job that I spent a few days on. I had not coded with Rails in a few weeks so it was a great refresher for a basic CRUD app. Used Rspec for a few tests. With this app you can create pizzas by adding toppings to your pizza. You can also create new toppings. I would say the most challenging aspect with this app had to deal with nested resources and models and changing data that saves in the database. It took me awhile to make the checkboxes work for toppings while making a pizza, but also once a pizza is made, the toppings that were selected then automatically become saved in the pizza description. I had to format this to have commas inbetween the toppings. Also learned the importance of modifiying data to make it follow certain rules like making sure no matter what words in whatever case are typed, the end result saves and shows with capital letters.</p>

Building the app via Test Driven Development with integration tests using Rspec and Capybara. Solidified more knowledge with routing. I am using bootstrap for the front-end. Did use the activeadmin gem, but later took it off because I wanted to learn and create a simplier admin dashboard. Additional features I am looking to build is an admin feature that allows admins to add points to the customer and for customer to use their earned points/rewards.</p>

            <p>My Dev Bootcamp Final 7 Day project in Rails - Trail Head is a hiking trail finder using Google Maps API and Trail API to give you hiking points all around the United States. Click on a trail to open up the specific trail's page giving you a chance to upload pictures and leave comments. Another feature that was developed was to be able to add new trail points to the map. Learned many things like how to build out a photo carousel and using carrier wave to upload pictures. Then being able to save the pictures to an Amazon S3 Server (finally without compromising the server key). Learned how to use CodeShip for continuous intergration/deployment to Heroku.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>This was my first time consulting someone on web technology to figure out how to start a retail clothing boutique online from scratch. There were two big solutions I was comparing, using WordPress with WooCommerce plugin vs Shopify. I helped my client decide to go with Shopify due to the usability and easy to manage interface for them. Shopify helped orgnize not only online inventory, but as well as inventory for their brick and mortar operations. For example if someone buys a red t-shirt at the physical store location, it would automatically remove one quantity of that red t-shirt from the online inventory and do this seamlessly and easy. Went through complete steps of buying a domain, purchasing and set up of Shopify, and best practices of running their business. Gained experience of asking lots of questions and listening to get an understanding of what the client wants and what type of solution can be provided. I experienced a little bit of everything, finding a technology, figuring out hardware, figuring out software (using 2 different apps), helping train someone on how to use the technology, and best ways to run the business efficiently, all while spending the least amount of money.</p>

            <p>Currently working on a retail app where you can pick your favorite stores that you love to shop at and it will show you current deals with those stores. I do have additional features I would like to build up to make it an easy to use interface and quick to the point. I am currently using Ruby on Rails, with Bootstrap 4 (which is in beta). I am using Devise for my authorization which is proving to be a challenge, especially since I am creating an admin login page as well. An admin will be able to add stores and deals. I have connected with a affiliated marketing API called ShopStyle, that I have coded to take a user's favorite brands and show them current live deals on products in those brands!</p>

            <p>This was my first time creating a Node.js app from scratch. Coming from a Ruby on Rails background, Node is very similar. It's the Javascript brother to Ruby in Rails. I learned many things including how to use the Node Package Manager (NPM). I used the following NPM packages: Express, EJS, Body-Parser, and Mongoose. Learned how Express is used for routing, and EJS was very similar to Embedded Ruby (ERB) files I used in Ruby on Rails. It was also my first time using a noSQL database: MongoDB, which I set up through <a href="https://mlab.com/" target="_blank">MLab</a>. I used NPM package Mongoose to help with connecting to my MongoDB. There are a lot more moving parts/modules you use when working in Node.</p>

            <p>For a technical challenge the goal was to use an API and have 2 endpoints. I used Yelp's API to build an app, where you can type in your zip code and click the "surprise me" button which will surprise you with a random place to eat. There is a second button named "list all" which will list the first 20 places to eat in the zip code provided. Used click through links so that if you click on the address it will open a new tab with Google maps showing the address, along with clicking the name of the restaurant will take you to the restaurant's Yelp page. Used Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap to make it look nice.</p>

            <p>This was my first attempt at learning how to use and set up WordPress, a content management system (CMS). It is a redesign for a family owned motel. Reason why I chose to use a CMS is to be in control of my own website and easily make changes in the future without spending too much time. My goals were to make it a simple, concise website that gets to the point and makes it easy for user's to book their stay. I fell into the world of WordPress plugins, where I learned how to balance my plugins and mess with the settings in every plugin to help with search engine optimization (SEO), page load speed, and the toughest part of making sure plugins do not interfere with other plugins or slow down the load speed of the site.</p>

            <p>Created a basic Todo app using Angular 2 and Angular CLI. Using the Angular CLI helped developing the app faster by using commands in the terminal to create components. The tutorial helped me understand how to build up a basic app, I felt like Angular 2's official tutorial was slightly confusing. Granted it was a tutorial, I did at the end add my additions to the code. I created a custom function that erases the input box after submitting or editing a todo item.</p>
