          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>This was a code challenge for a job that I spent a few days on. I had not coded with Rails in a few weeks so it was a great refresher for a basic CRUD app. Used Rspec for a few tests. With this app you can create pizzas by adding toppings to your pizza. You can also create new toppings. I would say the most challenging aspect with this app had to deal with nested resources and models and changing data that saves in the database. It took me awhile to make the checkboxes work for toppings while making a pizza, but also once a pizza is made, the toppings that were selected then automatically become saved in the pizza description. I had to format this to have commas inbetween the toppings. Also learned the importance of modifiying data to make it follow certain rules like making sure no matter what words in whatever case are typed, the end result saves and shows with capital letters.</p>

            <p>Currently working on this app for creating a phone number based loyalty rewards system for customers to earn points/rewards at a retail business. Building the app via Test Driven Development with integration tests using Rspec and Capybara. Solidified more knowledge with routing. I am using bootstrap for the front-end. Did use the activeadmin gem, but later took it off because I wanted to learn and create a simplier admin dashboard. Additional features I am looking to build is an admin feature that allows admins to add points to the customer and for customer to use their earned points/rewards.</p>

            <p>My Dev Bootcamp Final 7 Day project in Rails - Trail Head is a hiking trail finder using Google Maps API and Trail API to give you hiking points all around the United States. Click on a trail to open up the specific trail's page giving you a chance to upload pictures and leave comments. Another feature that was developed was to be able to add new trail points to the map. Learned many things like how to build out a photo carousel and using carrier wave to upload pictures. Then being able to save the pictures to an Amazon S3 Server (finally without compromising the server key). Learned how to use CodeShip for continuous intergration/deployment to Heroku.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>This was my first time creating a Node.js app from scratch. Coming from a Ruby on Rails background, Node is very similar. It's the Javascript brother to Ruby in Rails. I learned many things including how to use the Node Package Manager (NPM). I used the following NPM packages: Express, EJS, Body-Parser, and Mongoose. Learned how Express is used for routing, and EJS was very similar to Embedded Ruby (ERB) files I used in Ruby on Rails. It was also my first time using a noSQL database: MongoDB, which I set up through <a href="https://mlab.com/" target="_blank">MLab</a>. I used NPM package Mongoose to help with connecting to my MongoDB. There are a lot more moving parts/modules you use when working in Node.</p>

This was a tutorial from Angular 2's website. I did a little research/watched tutorials on Node.js and React.js and they all seem to use a similar component structure for front-end design.</p>

Learned how to use the Devise gem for authentication. Solidified knowledge regarding Rails back-end code placement. Learned how to manipulating the front-end with the bootstrap framework and use Sassy CSS. Also learned to AJAX and create a pagination with the Kaminari gem.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Created a basic Todo app using Angular 2 and Angular CLI. Using the Angular CLI helped developing the app faster by using commands in the terminal to create components. The tutorial helped me understand how to build up a basic app, I felt like Angular 2's official tutorial was slightly confusing. Granted it was a tutorial, I did at the end add my additions to the code. I created a custom function that erases the input box after submitting or editing a todo item.</p>

            <p>Created a fun simple game using javascript and jQuery. Player 1 would hit "Q" on the keyboard to move forward and player 2 would hit "P" on the keyboard to move forward. First one with 10 boxes/moves wins! Figured out a way to reset the board once a player has been declared as a winner. One of the learning points was seeing how to design the code so that data gets passed correctly from function to function.</p>
